# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

## STEP1:
Define a function.

## STEP2:
Get the two numbers from the user.

## STEP3:
Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.

## STEP4:
Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
```

def gcd():
    n1,n2=int(input()),int(input())
    if n1>n2:
        smaller=n2
    else:
        smaller=n1
    for i in range(1,smaller+1):
        if (n1%i==0 and n2%i==0):
            hcf=i
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",hcf) 
*/
```


## Output:
![gcd of two number](gcd.png)

## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
